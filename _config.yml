# A brief blurb about yourself
content: |
  <div class="bio">
    <p>
      I am a Data Operations Manager with <span class="hl">10+ years</span> of experience across ecommerce, SaaS,
      transactional platforms, and complex technical systems. My strength sits at the intersection of
      <span class="hl">systems</span>, <span class="hl">data</span>, and <span class="hl">operations</span>, where I turn messy,
      high impact problems into reliable, scalable processes.
    </p>

    <p>
      I ramp quickly on unfamiliar systems, trace difficult root causes, and spot edge cases others miss that
      materially influence strategy and outcomes. Operational workflows, data integrity, system reliability, and
      cross team execution are core to my work. I care deeply about quality, thoughtful planning, and building
      solutions that last.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am both technical and people focused. I build trust through accountability and consistency, and I am
      naturally curious, solution oriented, and energized by complex challenges that require both critical
      thinking and creativity.
    </p>
