      <p>
      👋🏽 I architect and lead business systems and technical operations that strengthen governance,
      reduce operational risk, and scale mission critical workflows.
      </p>
    <p>
      Over the past decade, I have driven both strategy and execution across eCommerce, CRM, EHR, compliance,
      logistics, payments, billing, and subscription based revenue models. I have strengthened commission and
      reconciliation processes by diagnosing complex data breakdowns, resolving edge cases, and collaborating
      with engineering to deliver durable, long term fixes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my current nonprofit leadership role, I serve as the organization's first Data Manager, where I
      introduced structured planning, Agile style execution, and continuous improvement practices. I
      advance data governance frameworks and stabilize core data infrastructure to improve reporting
      accuracy, protect data integrity, strengthen program accountability, and ensure system reliability.
