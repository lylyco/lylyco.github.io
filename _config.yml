# A brief blurb about yourself
content: |
  <div class="bio">
    <p>
      Systems Strategy and Technical Operations Leader with over eight years of experience across Ecommerce, SaaS, EHR, and financial services platforms. 
      I turn complex operational challenges into structured, scalable systems that improve visibility, reduce customer friction, lower costs, and increase team productivity.
    </p>

    <p>
      I specialize in deep data analysis, uncovering structural blind spots and edge cases that impact performance and decision making. I ramp quickly in unfamiliar environments 
      and prioritize quality, thoughtful planning, and long term durability over short term fixes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Equally technical and people focused, I build trust through accountability and consistency. Curious and solution driven, I apply critical thinking and creativity to design 
      systems that work for everyone and support sustainable growth.
