    <p>
      Hi, I am Lydia 👋🏽. Systems Strategy and Technical Operations Leader with over eight years of experience leading platform strategy and technical operations across Ecommerce, SaaS, EHR, and financial services. I 
      design and operationalize scalable systems that eliminate failure points, reduce customer friction, and improve cost efficiency and execution speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      I specialize in translating business objectives into technical execution, converting complex requirements into scalable specifications and exposing structural blind spots before they become 
      operational risk. I design workflows and automations that enable data driven decision making and measurable performance gains. I adapt quickly in new environments and prioritize durable system 
      design over temporary fixes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Equally technical and operationally aligned, I build trust through clear ownership, disciplined execution, and consistent delivery. I lead cross functional collaboration with accountability and 
      critical thinking, ensuring systems are adopted, maintained, and built for long term scale.
    </p>
