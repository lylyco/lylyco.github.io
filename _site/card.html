      <p>
      👋🏽 I architect and lead business systems and technical operations that strengthen governance,
      reduce operational risk, and scale critical workflows.
      </p>
      
    <p>
      Over the past decade, I have driven both strategy and execution across eCommerce, CRM, EHR, compliance,
      logistics, payments, billing, and subscription based revenue models. I have strengthened commission and
      reconciliation processes by diagnosing complex data breakdowns, resolving edge cases, and collaborating
      with engineering to deliver durable, long term fixes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently I am a Data Manager for a nonprofit organization where I introduced structured planning, Agile 
      style execution, and continuous improvement practices. I advance data governance frameworks and stabilize 
      core data infrastructure to improve reporting accuracy, protect data integrity, strengthen program accountability, 
      and ensure system reliability.
